🚀 Exciting News! Just completed my first SwiftUI project - a Weather App 🌦.

👨🏻‍💻This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive into the basics of SwiftUI and recreate the Apple Weather app. From setting up the project in Xcode to exploring the intricacies of SwiftUl, it's been an incredible learning journey.

📂 To check out my project, simply create an empty folder named weather-app, paste the resources, and open the complete project in Xcode. Make sure you have Xcode by Apple installed! 

🖼 l've also included a screenshot of my app in action. 

🎥 And for an even more immersive experience, a quick screen recording is also attached. 

🙌🏻 I'm thrilled to share my progress and welcome any feedback or suggestions. Learning SwiftUl has been a blast, and I'm excited for what comes next in my coding journey!
